                <p>Gautam Shantilal Adani (born 24 June 1962) is an Indian billionaire businessman who is the founder
                    and chairman of the Adani Group, a multinational conglomerate involved in port development and
                    operations in India. Adani has been described as being close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and to
                    his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party government. This has led to allegations of cronyism, as his firms
                    have won many energy and infrastructure contracts in India and abroad after Modi became the Prime
                    Minister of India. In January 2023, the American short selling activist firm Hindenburg Research
                    accused Adani of stock manipulation and fraud. In January 2024, the Supreme Court resolved the
                    Adani Group stocks dispute arising from Hindenburg Research's allegations. The Court dismissed
                    requests for an SIT or CBI investigation. Adani's and his family's fortune has plummeted by over 50%
                    to an estimated US$54.2 billion, as of October 2023, while falling to the 23rd place on the Forbes
                    Real Time Billionaires list. As of February 2024, his fortune was estimated to be US$82.3 billion,
                    placing him at the 16th place on the Forbes Real Time Billionaires list.</p>
